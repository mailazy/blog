Email is the accepted norm of correspondence for organizations of each size. A huge number of messages are sent each day, a constant discussion among organizations and their clients around the world!

However sending messages physically is tedious and blunder inclined. Doing as such at scale to a huge number of individuals is almost incomprehensible without the genuine consideration of a developer. While it's conceivable to compose programming to computerize your messages without any preparation, this unavoidably requires consistent support and upkeep.

### Building your own incorporation with an ESP is consistently conceivable yet has characteristic in risk: 

- The high chance expenses for an underlying form 
- The progressing cost of upkeep and overseeing updates and forms 
- It takes up to a year or more for a group of architects to execute 
- The expensive, tedious security and consistence confirmations 
- The weight of security infrastructure

Much of the time, these admonitions brief organizations to incorporate with an email API (application programming interface) stage like [Mailazy](https://mailazy.com/). This empowers engineers to rapidly add full email usefulness, transport items and go to advertise quicker. For developers, an all inclusive [RESTful API](https://mailazy.com/docs/api/email/) abstracts away the chaotic subtleties of sending email utilizing customary conventions and permits them to commit their endeavors to more significant item differentiators.

## What is an Email API?
An email API permits applications to get to capacities offered by the email specialist organization's foundation, including creating and sending value-based messages, controlling layouts, moving or altering envelopes, building drafts, and the sky is the limit from there. What's more, APIs empower incredible examination on this information â€” which you in any case wouldn't get by coordinating with the ESP straightforwardly. Email API suppliers deal with convention matters, for example, message gathering, message sending, and announcing that would somehow should be determined by the application programming advancement group. 

**Email APIs fall extensively into two classes**: transactional and contextual.

**Transactional** email APIs are intended for sending mass or routine messages like warnings, secret phrase reset messages, and mass promoting efforts through outsider stages. **MailChimp** and **SendGrid** are instances of all around created transactional email API suppliers. 

**Context oriented** email APIs are intended to insert vigorous email availability straightforwardly into programming applications. Efficiency devices, CRMs, candidate global positioning frameworks, and even vehicle supports use email APIs to insert email usefulness into the application. Context oriented messages permit you to adjust, send, get, and gather investigation, just as dealing with general CRUD for each email specialist organization association. The [Mailazy](https://mailazy.com/) Email API goes about as a layer of deliberation on top of all email suppliers and is an illustration of a relevant email API supplier. 

**We should venture through a model use case for a relevant email APIs**: a solitary incorporation for matching up and sending messages to and from numerous client's email service providers at the same time.

1. An occasion happens inside a web or versatile application, for example, a catch press to make an impression on somebody while seeing their profile. 

2. The email API stage develops a proper directive for each adjusted email service provider's determinations, embeddings the message content provided by the client application, and as indicated by procedural banners as wanted. 

3. The email API stage arranges the specialized handshakes for each associated administration, guaranteeing that messages arrive at every objective with respectability. 

4. The email API stage logs each trade and its specifics, to be summed up for insightful dashboards and indicative reports.

>Email APIs guarantee the most proficient I/O execution for email applications since they considerably decrease the measure of information that should be sent. In other words, applications don't have to communicate completely developed email messages with header data, **they can basically send key:value sets related straightforwardly to the substance of the message: subject, body, beneficiaries**.

#### Example of Email API

**Send Email API**
Sends email via the REST API interface. Pass the components of the messages such as `To`, `From`, `Subject` as JSON payload.

**Endpoint**
```text
https://api.mailazy.com/v1/mail/send
```
**Example**
```
  curl --location --request POST 'https://api.mailazy.com/v1/mail/send' \ 
  --header 'X-Api-Key: <API KEY>' \
  --header 'X-Api-Secret: <API SECRET>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{ "to" : ["john@example.com"], 
				"from": "Sender <sender@example.com>",
				"subject": "Hello, World!",
				"content": [{ "type": "text/plain", "value": "Hey! ....." }] 
			  }'
```
### Advantage of Email APIs
-   Ease-of-use
-   Fast implementation
-   Cost Savings at scale
-   Service Reliability
-   High Deliverability
-   Email list management (e.g. unsubscribe requests)
-   Reports and Analytics Dashboards
-   Deep personalization (contextual APIs)
-   Embeddable email functionality for applications (contextual APIs)
-   Enterprise-grade security

**Analytics**
Analytics are fundamental for any important evaluation of your email missions and email API suppliers are totally arranged as a mediator layer to help you track measurements, for example, 
- The number of messages were effectively conveyed.
- The number of messages were dismissed by an ISP.
- Purposes behind messages not being conveyed.
- The number of recipients opened a message.
- The number of source were clicked.
