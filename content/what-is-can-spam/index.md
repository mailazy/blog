The  [CAN-SPAM Act of 2003](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business)  standas for **C**ontrolling the **A**ssault of **N**on-**S**olicited **P**ornography **A**nd **M**arketing. This law lists the guidelines, requirements, and potential penalties for noncompliance regarding the commercial use of email and the legal rights of recipients of commercial email.

FTC will fine you $16,000 For **every**  **single**  **email** that violates the CAN-SPAM Act. So if you're caught being non-compliant for a list of, say, 1000 ... well, you do the math.

To be a CAN-SPAM compliant, it's important your email messages follow these rules, [which can be found in full over at the FTC's website](http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus61-can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business). CAN-SPAM provides several requirements for commercial senders including, but not limited to:

-   Senders can not use false or misleading headers in every email that sent out.
-   Senders can not use deceptive subject lines that misrepresent the contents of your message
-   Senders must provide a clear way to opt out of every email you send out and honor all opt-out requests.
- Senders cannot 1) charge a fee 2) restrict a recipient to provide personally identifying information beyond an email address, or 3) make recipients take extensive steps other than simply replying to an email or visiting a single page on a website to unsubscribe themselves from your emails.

This is by no means a complete description of CAN-SPAM, please visit the  [CAN-SPAM Act Compliance Guide](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business)  for more information.

CAN-SPAM is not limited to bulk email. Any commercial email communication, including business-to-business and business-to-customer email, is covered by the CAN-SPAM Act.
