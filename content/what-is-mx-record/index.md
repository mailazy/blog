A DNS Mail Exchange (MX) record in the DNS system specifies a mail server responsible for accepting email addresses on behalf of a domain. 
The MX record indicates how email messages should be routed, The MX records associated with a domain assure that the email is properly routed via Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
Like CNAME records, an MX record must always point to a domain/ip.
