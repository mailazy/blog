DNS stands for Domain Name System. This is a naming system that defines your domain on the internet. When Mailazy refers to your DNS, we refer to your domain name from where you want to send emails such as `example.com` or `domain.com`. 

When we refer to your DNS provider, we indicate to the service that hosts your domain name. For example, Cloudflare or GoDaddy.
